# Java Spring REST API Implementation Guide

This document outlines the step-by-step implementation of the API specified in `spec.md`. Each section represents a single development iteration, following Test-Driven Development principles.

## Iteration 1: Project Setup and Basic Structure
**Status**
Completed

**What we'll implement:**
- Initialize a Spring Boot project with Gradle
- Configure MongoDB connection
- Set up basic project structure following package-by-feature organization
- Create the User data model
- Implement health check using Spring Boot Actuator

**Development tasks:**
1. Create a new Spring Boot project with Gradle
2. Add Spring Boot Actuator for health checks
3. Configure MongoDB connection in application.yml
4. Set up package structure
5. Implement the User model with validation using Lombok
6. Write tests for the User model

**Completed Implementation:**
- Set up a Spring Boot project with Gradle using Java 21
- Added Lombok to reduce boilerplate code
- Implemented Spring Boot Actuator for health checks at `/api/v1/health`
- Created MongoDB configuration
- Implemented the User model with proper validation
- Added comprehensive test cases for the User model
- Configured logback for structured JSON logging

## Iteration 2: User Repository Layer
**Status**
Not started

**What we'll implement:**
- Create the MongoDB repository for User entities
- Implement custom repository methods for case-insensitive email handling
- Write unit tests for the repository layer

**Development tasks:**
1. Create UserRepository interface extending MongoRepository
2. Implement custom methods for email uniqueness validation
3. Write tests for basic CRUD operations and custom methods
4. Configure test environment with mocked MongoDB

## Iteration 3: User Service Layer
**Status**
Not started

**What we'll implement:**
- Create the service layer for handling business logic
- Implement CRUD operations in the service
- Add validation logic for user input
- Write unit tests for the service layer

**Development tasks:**
1. Create UserService interface
2. Implement UserServiceImpl with required CRUD operations
3. Add validation logic for user data
4. Write comprehensive tests for the service layer using Mockito

## Iteration 4: User Controller - Read Operations
**Status**
Not started

**What we'll implement:**
- Create the REST controller for User endpoints
- Implement GET endpoint for retrieving users by ID
- Set up error handling for common scenarios
- Write unit and integration tests

**Development tasks:**
1. Create UserController with proper request mapping
2. Implement GET by ID endpoint
3. Add error handling for user not found scenarios
4. Write tests for the controller endpoints

## Iteration 5: User Controller - Write Operations
**Status**
Not started

**What we'll implement:**
- Implement POST endpoint for creating users
- Add validation for incoming requests
- Write tests for create operations

**Development tasks:**
1. Implement POST endpoint in UserController
2. Add request validation using Bean Validation
3. Handle duplicate email errors
4. Write tests for create operations

## Iteration 6: User Controller - Update Operations
**Status**
Not started

**What we'll implement:**
- Implement PUT endpoint for full user updates
- Implement PATCH endpoint for partial user updates
- Write tests for update operations

**Development tasks:**
1. Implement PUT endpoint for full updates
2. Implement PATCH endpoint using JSONPatch or custom logic
3. Ensure validation is applied to updates
4. Write tests for both update operations

## Iteration 7: User Controller - Delete Operation
**Status**
Not started

**What we'll implement:**
- Implement DELETE endpoint for removing users
- Write tests for delete operation

**Development tasks:**
1. Implement DELETE endpoint
2. Add proper response handling for successful deletion
3. Write tests for delete operation

## Iteration 8: API Documentation and Logging
**Status**
Not started

**What we'll implement:**
- Add OpenAPI documentation using Springdoc
- Configure Logback for JSON structured logging
- Add request/response logging

**Development tasks:**
1. Add Springdoc OpenAPI dependencies
2. Configure Swagger UI
3. Add API documentation annotations
4. Configure Logback for JSON logging
5. Implement request/response logging

## Iteration 9: Final Integration Tests and Polish
**Status**
Not started

**What we'll implement:**
- Comprehensive integration tests
- Code cleanup and refactoring
- Final validation against specification requirements

**Development tasks:**
1. Write end-to-end integration tests
2. Review and refactor code as needed
3. Verify all specification requirements are met
4. Final testing and documentation review
