# Future Considerations

This document captures all aspects of the project that were deemed **not important for now** but might be considered in the future.

## Error Handling & Response Structure
- Standard HTTP 4xx and 5xx responses are sufficient for now.
- No custom exception handling beyond Springâ€™s default mechanisms.
- No structured response objects for success/error handling.

## Code Coverage
- No minimum code coverage enforcement at this stage.

## Response Headers
- No specific response headers (e.g., `Location` on resource creation) are required for now.

## Pagination
- Not needed for listing users at this time.

## Deployment & Configuration
- No Docker configuration is required.
- No use of Spring Boot profiles (`dev`, `prod`, etc.).
- No environment variable configuration; everything will be managed in `application.yml`.

## Security & Authentication
- No authentication or authorization is required for now (to be implemented later).

## Logging & Monitoring
- No request rate limiting is required.
- No response compression (e.g., GZIP) is needed.
- No logging of all database queries.

## API Lifecycle
- No API deprecation notices for future changes.

## Batch Operations
- No need for batch operations (e.g., bulk user creation or updates).

These considerations can be revisited later as the project evolves.
