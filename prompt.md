There is a file in this codebase called spec.md
that include a detailed specification for a java spring app that I want to build.
I want you to break it down into small, iterative pieces that you can implement.

Some rules:
* Ignore iterations with a status of completed.
* Each iteration of implementation must fit in with what has come before it.
* Implement with TDD to ensure correctness at all times.
* Everything should be cohesive and there should be no orphaned code.

At each stage of the journey I want you to update a file called implementation-instructions.md
with the following information
* A set of detailed prompts of what you are about to implement.
* Whether the iteration is completed or not
* Rough costs of implementing that iteration
